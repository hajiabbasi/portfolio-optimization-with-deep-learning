# portfolio-optimization-with-deep-learning
In this project, we have implemented concepts ranging from simple financial principles such as risk and return to more complex financial theories. Based on this, a module named **mahdi** has been created to facilitate the implementation of these concepts in future projects. 

Furthermore, portfolio optimization has been conducted in the Iranian stock market. Given that the value of the national currency in Iran decreases annually, the US dollar is used as an investment option. In the next project, titled **Tehran Stock Exchange with USD**, portfolio optimization will consider the dollar as the investment factor.

This file includes explanations of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), Sharpe Ratio, semi-volatility, Yield to Maturity (YTM), annual volatility, and Modern Portfolio Theory. If you are interested in seeing the portfolio optimization solely through the application of classic machine learning models, please refer to the file **modern1**.


where:
- \( \sigma_p^2 \) is the variance of the portfolio's returns,
- \( \mathbf{w} \) is the vector of asset weights,
- \( \mathbf{C} \) is the covariance matrix of asset returns.

Following this theoretical foundation, we utilized very simple machine learning models to predict prices and subsequently constructed a portfolio based on these predictions.
