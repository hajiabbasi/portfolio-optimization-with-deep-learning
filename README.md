# portfolio-optimization-with-deep-learning
In this project, we implemented simple financial concepts such as risk and return, progressing to more complex financial ideas. Based on this foundation, a module named "mahdi" (after myself) was created to facilitate the implementation of these concepts in future projects. Additionally, portfolio optimization was performed in the Iranian stock market. 

Given the annual depreciation of the national currency in Iran, the US dollar was chosen as an investment option. In the next project, titled "Tehran Stock Exchange with USD," portfolio optimization was conducted with the dollar considered as an investment factor. This file includes explanations about Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), the Sharpe Ratio, and Modern Portfolio Theory.
